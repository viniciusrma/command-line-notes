# Welcome!

This is a resume about command line. Hope you enjoy it!

From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Finder on Mac OS or Windows Explorer on Windows.

The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.

- In the terminal, first you see '$'. This is called a shell prompt. It appears when the terminal is ready to accept a command.

A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure. 
It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:

-   'pwd' stands for “print working directory”. Outputs the name of the current working directory.
-   'ls' means 'lists' all files and directories in the working directory. In filesystem folders are called directories
-   'cd' means change directory switches you into the directory you specify.
-   '$ cd ..' move up one directory.
-   'mkdir' means "make a directory". It creates a new directory in the working directory.
-   'touch' creates a new file inside the working directory.
